                                devices laid the groundwork for modern computing. The first electronic programmable
                                computer, ENIAC, was developed in the 1940s, marking a significant milestone in
                                computing history. The theoretical foundation was established by figures like Alan
                                Turing, who proposed the idea of a universal machine capable of performing any
                                computation.</p>

                            <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component of
                                modern computing systems, enabling fast data access and
                                processing. RAM is a type of volatile memory used in

                                the CPU needs while performing tasks. Unlike permanent
                                storage (like hard drives), RAM loses its contents when the
                                power is turned off. It allows for quick read and write
                                access to a storage medium, which significantly enhances
