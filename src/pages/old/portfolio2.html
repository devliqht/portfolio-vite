                    <p><span class="ibm-plex-mono-regular" style="color: var(--site-light-blue); font-size: 1.7rem;">Information Systems</span> are a coordinated set of components and resources that collect, process, store, and distribute information. These systems typically include hardware, software, data, people, and procedures. They are designed to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization or enterprise. A book defines Information Systems (IS) as systems that collects, processes, stores, analyzes and disseminates information for a specific purpose.</p>

                <div class="enclosed">
                   <p>The term ‚Äúinformation‚Äù is ambiguous.  At its core, "information" can be seen as a collection of data that has been processed, structured, or presented in a way that makes it meaningful to a recipient.</p>
                   <div class="spacer"></div>
                   <p>There are three principal uses of the word information, as according to Buckland's book about Information and Information Systems:</p>
                   <ul>
                        <li><span style="color: white">Information-as-process</span>, what someone knows is changed when he or she is informed.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: white">Information-as-knowledge</span>, information is also used to denote that which is imparted in information-as-process.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: white">Information-as-thing</span>, information is also used attributively for objects, such as data and documents, that are referred to as information because they are regarded as being informative.</li>
                   </ul>
                </div>
                <h1 id="def-info">Definitions of Information</h1>

                                <li>Information transforms an individual‚Äôs understanding or knowledge. It involves the act of becoming informed, where what a person knows is altered. Essentially, information represents the act of conveying knowledge‚Äîeither through telling or being told. This process is about the exchange and communication of information.</li>

                                <li>Information is the understanding or insights that individuals gain from processing and interpreting information. It highlights that information is not just raw data or facts but becomes valuable when it is comprehended and integrated into one's existing framework of understanding.</li>

                                <li>Information is considered as a tangible or concrete entity. In this context, information is viewed as a physical or digital object that can be stored, retrieved, and transferred. This could include documents, files, books, databases, or any material form where information is recorded.</li>

                    <p>Hardware represents the physical components of an information system. Some can be seen or touched easily, while others reside inside a device that can only be seen by opening up the device's case. Keyboards, mice, pens, disk drives, iPads, printers, and flash drives are all visible examples. Computer chips, motherboards, and internal memory chips are the hardware that resides inside a computer case and not usually visible from the outside.</p>

                    <h3>Software</h3>
                    <p>Software is a set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is not tangible ‚Äì
                        it cannot be touched. Programmers create software programs by following a specific
                        process to enter a list of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. There are several
                        categories of software, with the two main categories being operating-system and
                        application software.</p>

                        retrieval, and ensuring data quality, such as accuracy and completeness. Security measures,
                        including encryption and access controls, protect data from unauthorized access and
                        breaches. Effective data analysis helps in understanding trends, predicting future outcomes,
