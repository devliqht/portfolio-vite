                    <p>
                        A motherboard is a critical component of a computer system, acting as the main circuit board that
                        connects various hardware components, allowing them to communicate. It is often referred to as the
                        mainboard, system board, or logic board. It serves as the central hub that connects and facilitates
                        communication between various hardware components, including the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and
                        expansion cards. Without a motherboard, the individual components of a computer cannot interact effectively.
                        The design and specifications of motherboards have evolved significantly since their inception, accommodating
                        advances in technology and user needs.

                    <p>
                        The concept of the motherboard evolved from earlier technology known as the backplane, which was
                        simply a circuit board that connected various components without integrating them. The first motherboard as
                        we know it today was introduced by IBM in 1981 with the Planar Breadboard, designed by engineer Patty
                        McHugh. This board housed essential components like the CPU and RAM, marking a significant milestone in
                        computer architecture.

                    <h2 id="history">History of Motherboards</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1970s-1980s: The concept of a motherboard began to take shape with early PCs, like the Apple II in
                            1977, which used single, large circuit boards to mount processors, memory, and other components.
                            IBM‚Äôs 1981 PC introduced the term "motherboard" more formally, featuring an open architecture that
                            allowed for expansion cards and peripherals.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1981: Introduction of the Planar Breadboard in IBM's first personal computer.</li>
                                <li>1984: Release of the Advanced Technology (AT) motherboard, which set a standard for future
                                    designs.</li>
                                <li>1985: Introduction of the Baby AT motherboard, which was smaller and more compatible with
                                    various PC cases.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>1990s: As personal computers became more mainstream, motherboard designs became standardized,
                            with AT (Advanced Technology) being an early form factor. Later, the ATX (Advanced Technology
                            eXtended) form factor emerged, which became a widespread standard and introduced better layout
                            designs, cooling, and ease of expansion.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1995: Development of the ATX form factor by Intel, which improved layout and airflow and
                                    became the most widely adopted standard</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>
                            2000s-Present: Since the 2000s, motherboards have evolved to support more advanced CPUs, GPUs,
                            and connectivity options like USB, SATA, and PCIe. They also began to incorporate features for
                            overclocking, RGB lighting, and Wi-Fi connectivity, catering to gaming and enthusiast communities.
