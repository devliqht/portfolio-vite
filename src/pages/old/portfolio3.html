                    <p>
                        The first true written positional numeral system is generally attributed to the ancient Babylonian civilization. It
                        emerged around 3000 BCE influenced by earlier Sumerian systems. It was primarily used in ancient
                        Mesopotamia for trade, astronomy, and record-keeping and was based on a sexagesimal (base-60) system.
                    </p>
                    <div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>
                        The sexagesimal system was an ancient system of counting,
                        calculation, and numerical notation that used powers of 60
                        much as the decimal system uses powers of 10. Rudiments of
                        the ancient system survive in vestigial form in our division of the
                        hour into 60 minutes and the minute into 60 seconds.

                        Although it is a positional system, it lacks a true zero, which can
                        complicate calculations and representations. The absence of
                        zero means that the system relies on spacing to indicate the
                        absence of a value, which can be less intuitive.

                    <p>
                        While the Babylonian's Sexagesimal system was the first true positional numeral system, the Hindu-Arabic
                        system was also one of the number systems that influenced modern mathematics and also introduced the
                        number.

                        The Hindu-Arabic numeral system is a decimal (base-10)
                        system, meaning it uses ten distinct symbols to represent
                        numbers. Each position in a number corresponds to a power of
                        ten, allowing for the representation of large numbers with
                        relatively few symbols.
        
                        Developed between the 1st and 4th centuries CE in India and
                        later spread to the Middle East and Europe by the 9th century. It
                        became widely adopted in Europe during the 13th century due to
                        the works of mathematicians like Fibonacci.

                        digit within a number determines its value. The value of a digit depends not only on the digit itself but also on its
                        position or place in the number, and the base (or radix) of the number system being used. It uses a set of digits
                        to represent the value of a number. The product of each digit and its place value indicates the value of the digit.
                        The sum of those products is the value of the number.</p>

                        in the world. The decimal number
                        system has 10 symbols, mainly 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The position of every digit has a weight which is a

                        10 raised to the corresponding position number (which is
                        also called its weight), and this process repeats for all the
                        digits in the decimal number. The figure proves the

                    <p>The binary number system is a way of representing numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. It is a base-2
                        system, meaning each position in a binary number represents a power of 2. Unlike the decimal system, which
                        uses ten digits (0-9), binary only uses two, making it essential in computing because digital systems like
                        computers process data in binary form.</p>
                    <div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>In figure 5, we can see the binary number 11001. Since
                        it's the Base-2 system, that means that we multiply the
                        digits by 2 raised to the corresponding position number
                        (similar to that of a decimal number). Hence, our first
                        digit (starting from the right) or also known as the Least
                        Significant Bit, is multiplied by 2^0, and the second
                        digit by 2^1, so on and so forth.</p>
                    <div class="spacer"></div>
                    <p>We disregard zero since 0 multiplied with anything still equates to zero. Therefore, we are left with 1x2^0, 1x2^3
                        and 1x2^4. Adding all of these products together gives us the base 10 conversion of this binary which is 25.</p>
