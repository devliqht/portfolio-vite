                    <p>The concept of a computer has evolved significantly over time. Early mechanical
                        devices laid the groundwork for modern computing. The first electronic programmable
                        computer, ENIAC, was developed in the 1940s, marking a significant milestone in
                        computing history. The theoretical foundation was established by figures like Alan
                        Turing, who proposed the idea of a universal machine capable of performing any
                        computation.</p>

                        a system where data and instructions are stored in memory. This architecture allows the

                        the CPU needs while performing tasks. Unlike permanent

                        Air cooling utilizes fans
                        to blow air over
                        heatsinks attached to
                        heat-generating
                        components like the CPU
                        and GPU. The heatsink
                        absorbs heat from the
                        component, which is
                        then dissipated into the
                        air by the fan.

                        Software refers to a collection of instructions, data, or programs that enable a computer to perform specific
                        tasks. It is an essential component of computer systems, functioning alongside hardware to facilitate various
                        operations. Software can be broadly categorized into different types based on its purpose, licensing models,
                        and distribution methods.

                        low level. The OS serves as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, managing tasks such
                        as memory allocation, file management, and device control.

                    <p>
                        A device driver is a specialized program that allows the OS to interact with hardware devices such as printers,
                        graphics cards, and network adapters. Without these drivers, the OS would not be able to control or utilize the
                        hardware effectively. Each driver is tailored to a specific type of device and is dependent on both the hardware
                        it controls and the operating system it operates within.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Device drivers operate in conjunction with the OS kernel,
                        which manages system resources. When an application
                        requests an action involving hardware (like printing a
                        document), the OS sends this request to the relevant driver.
                        The driver then communicates directly with the hardware to
                        execute the command and returns any results or status
                        messages back to the OS.
